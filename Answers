Thripshaw's Disease - An example with Bayes Rule

The test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease
10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer
Estimated that 0.5% are sufferers of Thripshaw's Disease

For this exercise, we suppose that the test is administered to a person with an unknown disease status.  What are the probabilities for the following:

1. Probability that the test will be positive
P(A) = probability of getting a positive result
P(B) = probability of actual sufferer of diseases

P(Positive Test)*P(Infected) + P(non-suffering populuation)*P(non-suffering population minus 5% suffering population)
P(.98)*P(.005) + P(.1)*P(1-.005)
P(.98)*P(.005) + P(.1)*P(0.995)
.0049 + .0995 = .1044

2. What is the probability of correctly identifying a sufferer of Thripshaw's disease?
.98 (The test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thirpshaw's Disease)

3. What is the probability of correctly identifying a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's Disease?
Take 100% (1) and minus the 10% probability of getting a (false) positive (.10)
1 - .10 = .9

4. What is the probability of misclassifying the person as a sufferer of Thripshaw's Disease?
100% (1) - (positive test * sufferer + non-sufferering probability * non-suffering population minus the suffering population)
1 - (.98 * .005 + .9 * .995) = 
1 - (.9004) = 0.0996
